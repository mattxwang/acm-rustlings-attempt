[Verse 1]
I've been hiding for so long
These feelings, they're not gone
Can I tell anyone?
Afraid of what they'll say
So I push them away
I'm acting so strange

[Chorus]
They're so pretty it hurts
I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls
They're so pretty with their button-up shirts

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't be feeling this
But it's too hard to resist
Soft skin, and soft lips
I should be into this guy
But it's just a waste of time
He's really not my type
I know what I like
No, this is not a phase
Or a coming of age
This will never change

[Chorus]
They're so pretty it hurts
I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls
They're so pretty with their button-up shirts
They're so pretty it hurts
I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls
They're so pretty with their button-up shirts

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't know what to do
It's not like I get to choose who I love
Who I love, who I love, who I love

[Chorus]
They're so pretty it hurts
I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls
They're so pretty with their button-up shirts
And they're so pretty it hurts
I'm not talking 'bout boys, I'm talking 'bout girls
They're so pretty, it hurts
